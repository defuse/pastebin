Defuse.ca's Pastebin
====================

**WARNING: I am no longer maintaining this code. Use at your own risk.**

This code is ripped out of defuse.ca's pastebin. It does not work on its own
but with some modification you should be able to get it to work:

- Replace "defuse.ca" hard-coded strings with your own domain.
- Make sure all the paths are correct.
- Set up the apache redirection rules.
- pastebin.html is supposed to be a PHP file with the homepage (this was
  ripped out of my CMS so it's missing the HTML &lt;head&gt; and stuff.
- Lots of other stuff I'm probably forgetting.

Good luck!
